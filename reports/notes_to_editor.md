## 1.1 Guidelines used in the submission

Of the Guidelines descrived in [Economist Guidelines](/https://design-system.economist.com/documents/CHARTstyleguide_20170505.pdf) the following have been closely followed:

- Rotated Red Tag to distiguish every graph;
- The font chosen: Econ Sans Cnd Medium used for titles, and, Econ Sans Cnd light used for subtitles and descriptions;
- Reference at the bottom and with the right formatting: as in the infographic case, only one reference has been used, everything is then referenced to [LiberiamoliTutti!](/https://github.com/ondata/liberiamoli-tutti/tree/main/sbarchi-migranti)
- Color Palette: The color palette described at page 12  of [Economist Guidelines](/https://design-system.economist.com/documents/CHARTstyleguide_20170505.pdf) has been used for all plots,
- Clarity of graphs: with all quantities referenced
- Pie charts: the colors have again been used accoring to page 20 of [Economist Guidelines](/https://design-system.economist.com/documents/CHARTstyleguide_20170505.pdf). Moreover for the pie chart the title of the single ones, namely the year, has been inserted in the center. 
- Maps: According to [Economist Guidelines Maps](https://design-system.economist.com/documents/MAPstyleguide_20170505.pdf) the blue palette has been chosen. Morevoer:
  - country borders: have been coloured in white, and made of width 0.75 pts,
  - regional borders: have been made dashed in white, of width 0.5 pts, 

## 1.2 Guidelines not met 

The main Guidelines not met:
- Distancing whitin plots: the distancing in terms of pts for the spacing within a plot has not been followed. The main reason for this is that this gave problems when combining different plots in the infographic, mantaining untouched the proportions;
- Font for subtitles: while the font downloaded for Econ Sans Cnd Medium was working well, the version downloaded for Econ Sans Cnd light  hadn't any special charater. Working with a professional team would allow 
- Same proportions of the plots to keep high clarity


## 1.3 Discussion on possible alterations

With the assistance of a professional team of journalists, the main alterations I would do regard the visualization of the plots. Specifically I would seek their help and inights to choose which plots to keep, and how to make them more clear to yield quick visualizations. 
I would ask and discuss the effectiveness of the pie charts, and seek for other possible suggestions. 
Regarding the processing of the dataset there wouldn't be much to ask as it was from the beginning clear and  well organized. 
I would make use of the original fonts to obtain better writings on the infographic.
